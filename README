This code generates a csv file of total contributions broken down by contributor and year to a repository.

### How to run

Install dependencies 

`npm install`

Clone the `env` file 

`cp template.env .env` 

And define the GitHub token and other required params.

Then run `npm src/index.js`

A filed named `contributors_TIMESTAMP.csv` will be gradually generated with the contributions to that repository.
